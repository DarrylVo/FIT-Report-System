Hey future intern that is probably going to have to update this software.

TBF I wrote this while i was learning the web stack (front end javascript to the mysql/php stuff), 

so its probably a little messy. my bad. 

basic structure of this web app- view.* files handles the map stuff(creating the map, getting data out of the database,
displaying the data on the map) report.* files handles actually creating/validating the report, and sending it to the server
the register.html file is just an extra page to register a name + team id into the db. 

if you migrate this program into a new server, becareful about the mysql table names and columns and stuff
Hopefully ill have made an install script to do that for you. otherwise you gotta hunt through the code for the names. sorry!


This uses jquery, lightbox, leaflet, and maybe some other plugins for jquery i forgot. 

Its a rather simple program, didn't want to get too crazy with stuff like react/angular/w.e.

if you got any questions, email me dvo03@calpoly.edu. I'll answer any questions :D


Libraries Used:
Leaflet for maps
Lightbox for better picture viewing
Jquery
jquery validation plugin
jquery form submit pugin
getID3 to get out gps info from the videos/pictures

Mysql for database
