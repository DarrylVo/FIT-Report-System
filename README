Hey future intern that is probably going to have to update this software.

TBF I wrote this while i was learning the web stack (front end javascript to the mysql/php stuff),

so its probably a little messy. my bad. 

basic structure of this web app- view.* files handles the map stuff(creating the map, getting data out of the database,
displaying the data on the map) report.* files handles actually creating/validating the report, and sending it to the server
the register.html file is just an extra page to register a name + team id into the db. testing files have a "test" prefix 

if you got any questions, email me dvo03@calpoly.edu. I'll answer any questions :D

Front end is mostly javascript with jquery to do most of the dirty work. Back end is php. I recommend rewriting this into something
better like python.

Libraries Used:
Leaflet for maps
leaflet cluster markers(NOTE- I edited the src file a little bit to fix some animations) 
Lightbox script for better picture viewing
Jquery
jquery validation plugin
jquery form submit pugin
jquery scrollTo plugin
jquery ui
getID3 to get out gps info from the videos/pictures
Bootstrap for some of the login pages ux
Mysql for database

Testing:
PHPunit with GUzzle to simulate post stuff
QUNIT


********************** IMPORTANT SETTINGS
(if you're using the snapshots off of AWS you don't have to worry, but these are some extra settings that are required for 
this thing to work)

if you have to rebuild the mysql database schema, hopefully i left some files regarding the database schema. otherwise go look in the php files. 

dont forget to adjust the php.ini (if using php) so that bigger files can be POSTed (aka the videos).

the photo/video also does an exec call to "exif" to read apple picture gps metadata, so run "sudo apt-get install exif" if its a new machine.

The php version im using is the packaged one from apt-get. I also created a soft link from php to the packaged version in usr/local/bin, which is php5 on the commandline. keep that in mind if the versions or somehting are causing problems!

Chrome requires an https connection in order to use the HTML5 geolocation feature. If the server ip address changes, you WILL
have https errors because I forced the apache webserver to use it. If the server IP changes, make sure to update the ssl certifcates
and the dns name (scvwdflood.org) in the AWS console. Basically, make sure scvwdflood.org points to the right ip address. i
I used "Lets Encrypt" to handle the ssl certificate stuff, look it up if you need to change the ssl certificate.

there are backup and restore scripts that save/restore from a s3 bucket called "fitreport". Credentials are in credentials.csv file one directy up from the apache root, along with the mysql db pass

****************
Possbile project extensions:
So if you got this project, most likely something broke (most likely the meta data extraction is broken)

After you finish fixing (or if somehow everything is still working) here are some projects i recommend:
1. rewriting all the php server scripts to python. or just making the php scripts better. 

2. creating an iphone/android app for the reporting in order to create some kind of offline mode that can save all the reports offline and can flushes all the reports 
when theres cell/wifi signal

3. migrate the entire thing to amazon web services. I think you could literally have this app live entirely off of amazon 
(dynamoDB + the beanstalk or something???) instead of running off an ec2 instance. 

4. rewrite the program into some kind of framework (angularJS, react, etc...) instead of just straight up using jquery

5. Security- This program has minimal security for its login system. At most I have really shitty php session stuff/cookies to handle logins, 
https, hashed passwords, and prepared statements for the mysql quieries. THe really shitty part is the sessions/cookies. 
Improving security would be good, not that it really matters if someone really wanted to hack it xd xd.

6. Ask anyone who you're working with if they need any kind of software that would make their jobs easier!
